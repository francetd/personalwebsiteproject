  <h1><center>Future Goals</center></h1>
  <h2>Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?</h2>
  <p class="demo">
    In the future, I hope to see myself work in a company where I am able to collaborate well with other employees and strive to obtain deep expertise in whichever
    environment I am in. I am eager to experience any new challenges along the and am highly motivated to accomplishing any goals set by that company. In all, I hope
    to advance within my given company and career and have both a good work-life balance.
  </p>
  <h2>Potential Careers and Interests</h2>
    <center><h3>UI/UX Designer</h3></center>
    <p class="demo">
      Knowing how much I love art, combining this with MIS would be the best option for me. Though I just got aware of this career path this year,
      I plan to take additional UI/UX classes outside of college in order to gain more momentum in this field. I also hope to gain exposure in collaborating
      with other people for projects I can incorporate to my portfolio in the future.
    </p>

    <center><h3>HRIS Analyst</h3></center>
    <p class="demo">
      This semester I took an Human Resource course to obtain more knowledge on HR. I have always been a person who loved teamwork and developing good relationships with my
      colleagues and co-workers. This combined with my analytical skills on process design and flows, is all the more reasons why I would want to be an HRIS analyst.
    </p>

    <center><h3>ERP Analyst</h3></center>
    <p class="demo">
      I am often into providing solutions to problems, and within my MIS major, finding solutions to business processes have always been fun to me.
      Itâ€™s almost like finding the perfect fit to a puzzle. With my experience in using ERP and process software systems prior, this career seems like a potential path for me.
    </p>

    <center><h3>Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) Volunteer</h3></center>
    <p class="demo">
      Working within the district attorneys office as a part-time job allowed me to become more interested in the criminal justice system and the foster care system.
      Because of this, I have researched and found that becoming a CASA advocate in my spare time would be something that I want to do in the future.
      A CASA volunteer helps advocate for abused and neglected children with bests interests in mind. I would want to provide help specifically for our community in general in the future.
