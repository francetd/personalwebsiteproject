# Personal Website/First Portfolio

The purpose of this code is to present my very first portfolio/personal website made from scratch using only HTML and CSS.

## Description

This made from scratch portfolio showcased my recent work and any design coding elements that I learned from my introduction to web development class. The plan was to design a site that would include graphics/features to make my portfolio more engaging, while retaining features that would keep it somewhat simple. I chose a marble effect background coupled with black texts to keep a clean yet artistic element within my platform. I also utilized some dotted borders within my headers for stylistic points. As far as the navagation bar goes, I utilized more of a hover effect within the linked page names and made sure to also include my name in logo format. 

In terms of pages, all of my pages are read vertically, with the exception of columns I utilized in my projects page. I also included a moveable/interactive resume component to both look at and download within the resume/contact me page including a fillable and functional form.  

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

*  macOS, Linux, and Microsoft Windows 

### Installing

* Before installing program, make sure that you have a text or source code editor compatible with the dependencies.  
* Because this is a made from scratch portfolio, there is no domain associated with this code.
* Download all files within the repository to your computer, this may be better if you can download this and put it in a seperate folder.

### Executing program

1. Again, all you need to do is just download all files within the repository to your computer.  

## Help

If there are any problems (i.e. missing pages or links) please let me know ASAP. 
Other than that, it is worthy to note that some minor issues exist within the pages including weird design on columns and the site being non-responsive for certain devices.
